After creating cloud9 the instance is automatically u can choose whatever operating system u want for example ubuntu 
Now we need to deploy an ecommerce website 
Now open the cloud9
Then go to bash and give the following commands
sudo su //switch to root user
apt-get update // This command is used to fetch all the packages and prepares to update all packages
apt-get install apache2 //   The 'apt-get' tool checks for any dependencies required by Apache2 and prepares to download and install them along with Apache2.
systemctl start apache2 // It is used to start the Apache2 web server service on systems that use systemd as their init system.
cd /var/www/html // navigates to that path
ls // gives what are the files are present in that path
cd .. // It goes to the one step back to the path which is www
Now it is in the path // /var/www
Now to delete the files in the html we need to give the permissions to the html 
chmod 777 html
Now we can remove the file index.html
rm index.html // it removes the file index.html
ls // returns no files were present 
now upload the files to the environment
index.html
login.html
style.css
cd //It is used for to go back completely 
cd /home/ubuntu/environment // it moves to the environment path and environment 
Now ls // gives all the files that we have uploaded
now copy these files to the /var/www/html path
cp index.html /var/www/html // it copies the file index.html file to html path
cp login.html /var/www/html //it copies the file login.html file to html path
cp style.css /var/www/html //it copies the file style.css file to the html path
cd /var/www/html //it changes the directory from environment to the html path
now we are in html directory 
ls // listouts all the files
